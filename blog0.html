      <h1 class="display-4" style="margin-top: 2%;">How I found my first <b><span id="pinktext">RCE?</span></b></h1>
      <hr style="height:4px;">
      <p>Hello everyone, this is a story of how I found my first RCE on a bug bounty program.<br>
        This is a private program and doesn't allow disclosure so let us assume that our target is redacted.com. This is a wide scope target. So, after running my subdomain enumeration scripts I passed the subdomains into <kbd>httpx</kbd> to get live subdomains.<br>
        I had over <kbd><span id="pinktext">14k</span></kbd> unique targets after probing.  
        At this point, I was searching for keywords like <kbd>internal, staging, stg, developer, admin, etc</kbd>.<br> While testing these interesting domains manually, I also ran the <kbd><span id='pinktext'>nuclei</span></kbd> technologies template on the live subdomains to see what technologies the target was using. Upon running this and parsing the output, I found out that one of the subdomains let us say <kbd><span id='bluetext'>'vuln.redacted.com'</span></kbd> was using <kbd><span id='pinktext'>Oracle WebLogic</span></kbd>. 
        <br>I knew there were <kbd><span id='bluetext'>CVEs</span></kbd> for weblogic. I ran the CVE templates from nuclei on <kbd><span id='bluetext'>'vuln.redacted.com'</span></kbd>. As I was expecting nuclei detected <kbd><span id='pinktext'>CVE-2017-10271</span> on <kbd><span id='bluetext'>'vuln.redacted.com'</span></kbd>.<br>
        <kbd><span id='bluetext'>Vulnerable URL</span> : <span id="pinktext">https://vuln.redacted.com/wls-wsat/CoodinatorPortType</span></kbd>   
      
      <h1 class="display-4" style="margin-top: 2%;"><span id="bluetext">Exploiting </span><span id="pinktext">CVE-2017-10271</span></h1>
      <hr style="height:4px;">
      <p>In this section, we will be looking at how I exploited the and two mistakes I made while exploiting. One mistake was out of excitement of getting my first rce and other was a observational mistake.<br>
      At this point I stared googling for CVE-2017-10271 POC and also I have a poc from nuclei template.<br>
      Let's now look at steps to exploit CVE.<br>
      I intecepted the request in burp which looks like this.</p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/fantasticpanthom/7ebdf50a7f5f7dc04a855a75088b3871.js"></script> 
      <p>Without any second thoughts I attached payload to the get request and forwarded it.</p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/fantasticpanthom/50f203abe50fe7df04d6c2f5db53255c.js"></script>
      <p>Ofcourse the exploit did not work, I was supposed to make a POST request but instead out of excitement, I made a GET request.Realising my mistakes soon I change the request method to POST and send the below request.</p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/fantasticpanthom/b6cc321107244b074ef81a3c24311100.js"></script>
      <p>This should work right? NO , it did not. The server threw the below error this time.</p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/fantasticpanthom/5baf67ee5165a326d324b12c2a2fe4ca.js"></script>
      <p>What is the issue this time?<br>
        The <span id='bluetext'>Content-Type</span> entity header is used to indicate the media type of the resource.<br>
        We are playing with xml data but if we notice carefully Content-Type is set to <kbd><span id='pinktext'>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span></kbd>. For our exploit to work we need to set it to <kbd><span id='pinktext'>text/xml</span></kbd>.<br>
        The final error free POST request using which I could exploit the vulnerability is  
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/fantasticpanthom/dfbb7d8a2fb7a4972bb4fd70ce594681.js"></script>
        <p>On sending above request, the response came with a delay of approx <span id='pinktext'>12 seconds</span> which proved I had java code execution.<br>
      Then I used the below paylaod from nuclei template to read <kbd><span id='bluetext'>/etc/passwd of remote server</span></kbd></p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/fantasticpanthom/62881a1c0271067203ec7b9562abcc82.js"></script>
      <p>
        This is the story of my first remote execution and hope you learn from the mistakes I made which could have cost me my first rce.<br>
        Hope you enjoyed reading this and if you have any suggestions related to this or want to discuss with me about some security related stuff feel free to contact me.  <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html"><kbd>HOME</kbd></a> has my contact information.<br>
        HAPPY <span id="pinktext">LEARNING</span> and HAPPY <span id="bluetext">HACKING</span> !!!.
